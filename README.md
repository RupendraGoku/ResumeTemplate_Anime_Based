# ✨ Anime-Themed Portfolio Website 🎌

This is an **animated and interactive portfolio website** created with **React + Vite + Tailwind CSS**, inspired by the aesthetics of a random anime channel I stumbled upon — the vibes were so strong, I couldn't resist turning it into a personal project. 🌸

I first sketched a **low-fidelity design** using **Excalidraw**, and then transformed the vision into a dynamic portfolio using React with **reusable components**, **animation bits**, and proper **best practices**.

## 📌 About the Project

What started as a simple idea quickly became a **dream anime-inspired portfolio**, where every section reflects my style, creativity, and growing frontend skills.

I took inspiration from an anime channel’s visuals and:

- Drafted my layout in **Excalidraw** 📝
- Built it using **React + Vite**
- Designed the UI with **Tailwind CSS**
- Added subtle **animations** and transitions using Tailwind & React bits
- Used **React component architecture** to stay DRY
- Used **`map()`**, conditional rendering, and props for flexibility
- Structured the code for scalability and performance
- Made it responsive, lightweight, and full of personality

## 🌸 My Design Inspiration (Excalidraw + Anime)

I first planned the structure and vibe using [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) and got the anime feel from aesthetic-focused anime channels. The whole mood pushed me to build something that feels like a digital shrine to my love for creativity + coding + anime.
